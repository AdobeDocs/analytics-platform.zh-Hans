# Customer Journey Analytics B2B edition

{{b2b-edition}}

{{draft-b2b}}

Adobe Analytics最初是营销人员的Web和数字分析工具，而Customer Journey Analytics扩大了范围，包括多渠道、离线和跨平台数据。  Both tools help Business to Consumer (B2C) companies analyze and optimize their marketing efforts and customer experiences.

In B2B (business-to-business) sales, the purchase journey involves multiple parties, online and offline touchpoints, and key stages before closing a deal. B2B companies need to track all these interactions in a unified journey view to effectively analyze and optimize their marketing efforts and account experiences.

Typical B2B sales characteristics are:

* large transaction amounts
* long sales cycles
* multiple decision makers and influencers, usually forming a &quot;buying group&quot;
* more educated buyers
* increased importance on customer retention and upsell
* 千禧一代的B2B购买者期待更顺畅的“数字消费者”，比如购买体验

B2B营销侧重于优化接触点以及缩短购买和考虑周期。 由于B2B销售周期在很大程度上依赖于面对面会议、现场活动等线下互动，以及与购买团体合作，因此，仅基于数字人员的数据是不够的。 B2B组织使用CRM系统和专用解决方案的数据对此进行补充。 Yet traditional B2C marketing components, likreads, campaigns, channels, and site visitors still play a crucial role in B2B marketing.

B2B sales and marketing have evolved beyond traditional lead generation funnels to focus on customer lifecycles and buying groups. This shift reflects the changing nature of B2B purchasing, where decisions involve multiple stakeholders across various touchpoints. Today&#39;s B2B buyers follow a complex, non-linear decision-making process. Like B2C customers, they prefer to research independently before engaging with sales teams. Word of mouth and social media now play key roles in shaping their buying decisions.

B2B marketers face growing pressure to demonstrate how their activities contribute to revenue generation.  While aligning marketing efforts with business goals and measuring revenue impact is crucial, many measurement tools are designed for B2C scenarios. As a result, B2B marketers are seeking dedicated tools that provide accurate insights and align with their specific objectives.

Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition helps B2B companies align their marketing, sales, and product teams by providing actionable account insights that drive revenue growth. With the account placed at the center of the data model, all analysis focuses on the account journey. Adding a new layer of entities (accounts, opportunities, and buying groups) on top of person and time-based events, creates a complete picture of the B2B marketing and revenue lifecycle.
