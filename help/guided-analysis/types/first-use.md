## Query rail

The query rail allows you to configure the following components:

* **Key indicators**: The events that you want to measure per user. Each selected key indicator is represented as a colored line. A row representing the event is added to the table. You can include up to three events.
* **Factors**: The date that you want to compare before and after.
* **People**: The segment that you want to measure. The selected segment filters your data to focus only on the individuals who match your segment criteria.

## Chart settings

The Release view offers the following chart settings, which can be adjusted in the menu above the chart:

* **Metric**: The metric that you want to measure. Options include [!UICONTROL Events per user], [!UICONTROL Percentage of users], [!UICONTROL Events], [!UICONTROL Sessions], and [!UICONTROL Users].
* **Chart type**: The type of visualization that you want to use. Options include Line.

## Date range

Date selection in impact reports operate differently than other analysis types, since the report revolves around the date specified in the query rail. The following options are available:

* **Interval**: The date granularity that you want to view trended data by. Valid options include [!UICONTROL Daily], [!UICONTROL Weekly], [!UICONTROL Monthly], and [!UICONTROL Quarterly]. Changing the interval affects the options available for the Before and after period.
* **Before and after period**: The amount of time to analyze before and after the date specified in the query rail. Available options depend on the [!UICONTROL Interval] selection. -->
